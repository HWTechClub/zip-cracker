# zip-cracker

This program is used to crack zip files via 2 methods, bruteforce and dictionary attack. The bruteforce using catchphrases is using the zydra framework, which has been
incorporated into my python application.

## Please use this tool wisely and do not use it against unauthorized files. I will not be responsible for the same.

- To install:
1. make sure to install Python and pip3(Essential for this script to work).
2. run the requirements.py file to install necessary dependencies (todo)
3. run stable-crack.py

- Please issue anything if there is any bug/fault in the application.Since it's my first time building something like this.

###Thank you
